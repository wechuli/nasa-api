# nasa-api
Are you into astrology and space science, well of course you are. That why I built this simple front end application using some new es6 features with the nasa api
just load the html page with your browser(directly or with LiveServer) and the simple front-end page will start working. See the working project here http://appdevrojects.me/nasa-api/
